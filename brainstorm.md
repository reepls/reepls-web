- invalidate session: delete token from local storage, clear the auth state, redirect to login
- ath of auth object is lastime the access token was refreshed so can redirect if expired

# Errors Found:

- Recommended user and other recomended items have duplicates
- Comment with replies showing 0 reply count, comment with no replies showing >0 replies
- Find way to extract the actual error message from the backend not the generic axios error in react-query
- Inplace solution for empty id; just return an empty array but this whould be a temporary solution
- Too many requests(eg AuthorSuggestions)

- Popup when token expires (This should not happen regurlaly - current keeps trying to refresh token and is stuck and freezes the app)

# Considerations:

How to you extract the actual error message from the backend not the generic axios error in react-query (say when i do a mutation and it fails)? Right now i am just getting the error and error message like "Failed with status code 401"(bad request) which is from axios instead of the actual error message from the backend "User email already in use". I know it can be accessed on the axiosError with `error.response.data.error` but how do i get it in the mutation error?

Is there not supposed to be one QueryClient that is used throughout the app like the one in main.tsx? Because without that, things are behaving differently. Like there are some requests that will keep retrying indefinitely instead of all say retrying 3 times.

Something to look into: Both AuthProvider.tsx and apiClient.tsx are taking care of the token refresh. This should be handled
only by apiClient.tsx, right? Since that is the only one that makes the requests and can intercept the error and refresh the token.
AuthProvider should only be responsible for the auth state and not for the token refresh.

How to correctly handle authentication in react when it comes to jwts, access tokens and refresh tokens
using tanstack query, axios, and local storage

it's a really good idea to include a flag in your payloads, to indicate whether that token was generated by authenticating with user credentials, or by using a refresh token. You can use this flag to authorize sensitive operations, such as changing your password or making payments - so if the user didn't log in recently, you can prompt them to log in again for sensitive operations. I would say this is a must for most applications.

==========================================================================================================================

==========================================================================================================================

- Only see more if theere is more
- You dont need a toast for every success or error; just a few strategically placed ones

- Basic validation: comment should not be empty, comment should not be more than 255 characters,
- Comments should have see more and see less
- add profanity checking on frontend

- what shows on feed is recommended articles not all articles
- once user has viewed, it should not show in recommended articles or at least show with lower priority

- some data should be packaged from backend in one eg article data(article_data, ...reactions, ...comments,)
- loading icon

- group comments by author before rendering
- Refreshing not working well or something because requests keep failing
- Distinguish clearly btween what anonymous users can do and what logged in users can do

- if token refresh fails, redirect to login

- Way to extract the actual words from the html content so the TTS can read it

- Auto reize and compress images

Some Tasks for everyone:

-Implement a simple profanity filter with this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/obscenity and reject post creation as needed based on the content profanity
-Put together the infrastructure for TTS with google cloud api but dont integrate it with in the service yet; the api will be provided soon for testing

Do cleanup: That means to go throughtout the site and remove the goffy things that were put there in development: for example,
-remove _unncessary_ console logs,
-change things like placeholders to appropariate ones,
-displaying the appropriate messages for example login failed because of incorrect password not saying eror 404etc,

- Adding default views when content is empty; for example, when there are no posts, when there are no comments, when there are no saved posts, nothing in the following feed, etc

Clean up the frontend: There is still a lot of problematic inconsistencies in the frontend: for example,
-the fonts for the text vs the titles are not showing as the design stipulates,
-some shadows are not applied such as the signin button in dark mode,
-the text colors are not properly applied sometimes like profile page text in dark mode, the feed page in dark mode as well,

- the input to collect the username has still not been implmentedyou have still no
- the profile page behaves oposite of what I expect: when you click on profile button to go to _YOUR_ profile page, it should goto profile/ and when you click on other user's profile button it should goto profile/otheruser'susername but currently it is the other way around
- States shopuld be updated properly: when i click on follwoing, it should show the 'following or unfollow' if it successfully follows, after saving should go to saved, etc
- i see lots of failing requests: fetching the user profile sometimes, reactions failing, commenting failing,
- The loading component being used is not good(i meaning like for posting, sending comment); use an icon or a proper spinner
- React on comment has not been implemented
- I should be able to close the comment box after posting a comment/opening it to read comments
- When i click to comment, the other comments should automatically load and show up
- We have to start thinking about the scrolling situation for the right sidebar/communiques
- on feed page some things show over the sidebar

Things I will do:

- Style the media viewer to look better
- Implement storage of media to cloudinary
- Complete the creation and viewing of posts

Final Ui

- As Fabrice mentioned, continue working on the admin dashboard

Modal, Dialog, Popover, Tooltip, Tabs, Slider,
Alerts and Toasts

-Reactions + confeti/indicaion

- react-hot-toast or react-toastify
- sweetalert2 or

# To env

- API_URL
- CLOUDINARY_URL
- CLOUDINARY_KEY
- CLOUDINARY_SECRET
- CLOUDINARY_PRESET
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME

Problemss

- Check if online
- Load comments page by page
- There might be possibility fo xss attacks via editor????
- Alert for everything: account exits with email already in use,
- Should sideba r show when visiting other users [page?]

- Profile page and link disabled if not logged in

Do Next

- Fix the editor
- Be able to type and view drafts
- Connect to storage/ Setup storage
- Clean up styling
- Cleanup Layouts: Left Side bar | Top bar and then content | Right top barand its content
  -On upload of media, link should be persisted in case it needs to be deleted
